  Eggs are a quick, easy and delicious way to help meet our protein needs: two large eggs contain 13 grams of protein. Protein is important for building and maintaining muscle, fighting infections, and growing strong hair and nails. Including protein at meals and snacks also helps us to feel full and satisfied throughout the day. For delicious and protein-packed meal ideas, we’ve got you covered with a ton of amazing healthy egg recipes.
          <br><br>
          Did you know that the egg yolk contains almost as much protein as the egg white? The protein content of the white compared to the yolk is very similar, so eat the whole egg for all of its protein benefits!
<br> <br>
Eggs are one of the few foods considered to be a complete high-quality protein source, because they contain all 9 essential amino acids. ‘Essential’ means that the body cannot produce these amino acids on its own, which is why we need to include them in our diet. Amino acids are considered the building blocks for the body because they help to form protein.

          <h5>Burger</h5><br>
<blockquote cite="https://www.thedailymeal.com/eat/why-restaurant-burgers-best">
If you’ve ever tried to cook a burger in your home kitchen or on the grill, the results may have been hit or miss. Maybe it turned out perfectly cooked inside, but it was totally flavorless. Or maybe the outside had a nice char and salty flavor, but the inside was overcooked. But when you go to one of the 101 best burger spots in America, the patty is beautifully cooked on the inside, satisfyingly charred on the outside and packed with beefy flavor. What gives?
<br><br>
  Most top-notch burger places use a flat-top griddle to cook their burgers. These griddles are set at a consistent temperature, one that allows the burgers to get a sear while cooking evenly on the inside, locking in the juices. The patties are also often pressed into the griddle right after they hit the grill and then scraped off with a sharp spatula so that all of the crust comes with it.
Most great burger chefs can tell when a burger is cooked just by pressing on it, and they melt cheese on top by covering the patty with a bowl and squirting some water underneath, creating steam
Hamburgers are customarily eaten as a sandwich, between two halves of a round bun. Mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, and other condiments, along with garnishes of lettuce, onion, tomato, and sliced cucumber pickle, constitute the customary dressing. In the variation known as the cheeseburger, a slice of cheese is melted over the patty. The patty itself is often seasoned or augmented with chopped onions, spices, or bread crumbs before cooking

  Anyone who’s experienced pangs of hunger and cravings when looking at an ice cream cone can attest that the sugary, creamy treat is near irresistible. And it’s not just because our bodies, and tastebuds, have evolved to crave sugar on the regular. When you break down the chemistry behind ice cream, it’s easy to see why: It’s been engineered to the perfect combination of elements — sugar, fat, frozen water, and air — that make up the mouthwatering concoction.
<br><br>
Watch the video to understand the chemistry behind ice cream; we can’t promise that you won’t immediately want to go buy a pint after watching, but you’ll at least feel justified in your indulgence. It’s not your fault that ice cream is so tempting — it’s science
